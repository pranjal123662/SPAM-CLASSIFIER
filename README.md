Naive Bayes is a supervised classification technique based on Bayes' Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. I have a bunch of emails classified as 'spam' and a bunch of emails classified as 'ham' (not spam.) The emails are first read and stored in a dataframe. They are then parsed using CountVectorizer.This information is used to train the model and its prediction is then tested with a sample input
